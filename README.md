After launching for first time it will create properties file, in which you must specify csgo directory. One person hosts, other connect to him. Afterwards launch csgo, and execute sync_demo.cfg . To resume playing paused demo simultaneously, everyone except one press synchronisation button, and afterwards, the one who didnt, press demo resume button (although you have to do it within timelimit, which is 5 sec by default). To share your position or tick, press according button to send them out to others. The packet sent will be applied once they press synchronisation button.
